## PyTCC

### Introduction
PyTCC is a Python wrapper for the tiny C compiler library. The project
consists of two APIs: the pythonic API (pytcc.TCC) wich contains a
more pythonic API for TCC and the native API (pytcc.libtcc) wich
contains the raw ctypes prototypes that communicate with C.

### Installation
Just do:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

### Documentation
At the present time, the only documentation are the tests. However, when I complete the pythonic API,
I will document the module.

### Contributing
Contributions are very appreciated, especially in the documentation
section. To contribute, just create an issue or send a pull request on
GitHub and I wil check it.
